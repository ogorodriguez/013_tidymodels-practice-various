This practice site will be about the `tidymodels` package suite.

I will study following various websites and their corresponding examples.  

The examples are from users other than its authors: from people not connected to the creation nor maintenance of the packages that compose `tidymodels.`

`tidymodels.` is part of the tidyverse suite and it is the creation of [Max Kuhn](https://www.rstudio.com/authors/max-kuhn/), from the package `caret` fame.

Please visit the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) website for a deep and thorough study.
